# Rules
- Before adding a new endpoint to the API factory, ensure to do a global search (ctrl + Shift + F) to ensure it doesn't exist already
- The API factory modules is stuctured in terms of API modules and not sidebar modules like the rest of the app. I.e if you call and endpoint in dashboard that is typically `transaction/stats`, this would be under the transaction modules and not the dashboard module
